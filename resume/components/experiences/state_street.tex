\begin{itemize}
  % \item Developed a monitoring dashboard in OpenSearch to monitor indices transitions across all clusters
  % \item Designed and implemented a pipeline for AWS Transit Gateway logs from S3 Storage to OpenSearch
  % \item Separated existing CloudWatch logs pipeline into different streams to reduce data flow
  % \item Improved the efficiency of the pipelines and reduced average processing time by 10\%
  % \item Implemented AWS SQS to manage the flow of data in the pipelines to prevent throttling
  %\item Developed dashboards for near real-time monitoring nodes in OpenSearch cluster
  %\item Designed data pipelines to transfer logs from S3 to OpenSearch periodically, utilizing Lambda and SQS
  %\item Separated existing log pipeline loads into different streams to reduce operating costs by 10\%
  %\item Improved pipeline efficiency by optimizing Lambda functions and reduced 90th percentile latency by 20\%
  %\item Implemented AWS SQS to manage data flow and prevent Lambda throttling
  %
  \item Built observability dashboards in OpenSearch to monitor node health and log ingestion performance
  \item Designed pipelines to stream logs from S3, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail to OpenSearch using AWS Lambda
  \item Integrated Kinesis to optimize log streaming, reducing Lambda invocation costs by 10\%
  \item Refactored and tuned Lambda function, cutting tail latency by 20\% and preventing throttling by optimizing SQS
